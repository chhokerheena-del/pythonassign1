🧩 Project Overview

The Daily Calorie Tracker CLI provides a quick and straightforward way for students to monitor their daily calorie intake using only Python and the terminal. Users can input meal names along with their calorie values, calculate the total calories consumed, and check how it compares to their daily calorie limit.

This project helps reinforce basic Python programming concepts such as input handling, lists, arithmetic operations, and string formatting.
